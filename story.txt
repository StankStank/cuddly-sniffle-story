Once upon a time there was a cuddly bear but he always had a sniffle. He lived in a vast oak forest. 

One day, while consumed by a bout of the sniffles, he came across a tiny snail.  The snail announced
that he was a professor of otolaryngology at Vast Oak University, and that he knew all about sniffles.
