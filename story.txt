Once upon a time there was a cuddly bear but he always had a sniffle. He lived in a vast oak forest. 

One day, while consumed by a bout of the sniffles, he came across a tiny snail.  The snail announced
that he was a professor of otolaryngology at Vast Oak University, and that he knew all about sniffles.

The tiny snail removed an even tinier stethoscope from its briefcase.
It listened to the bear's sniffles, and then made some grim notes in his
notebook. It beckoned the bear closer, and then removed yet another thing
from its snail doctor briefcase.
